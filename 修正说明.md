##List of all known bugs:

###CSS issues

- Lots of style recalcs when we bring a story in (body.details-active .story__title etc)
```
body.details-active .story__title,
body.details-active .story__by,
body.details-active .story__score {
	/*transition: opacity 0.5s ease-out;
	opacity: 0 !important;*/
}
```

- Double shadow on .header
```
body.raised .header {
	box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16)
}
```

- Triple(!) shadow on .story__score and .story-details
```
.story-details { box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06); }
.story__score { box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06); }
```

- Promoted every single child element in .story-details. GO ME. This one will show up when they have visited a few stories. If they check the layers panel they'll see it too.
```
.story-details * {
	/*will-change: transform;
	transform: translateZ(0);*/
}
```
###onStoryData

- Loops through manually rather than using a querySelector to get the right element.
```
var story = document.getElementById('s-' + key);
```
- Makes visual changes outside of a rAF.
```
function colorizeAndScaleStories() {
	...
	var bodyPosition = document.body.getBoundingClientRect();
	var storyElementsInScreen = [];
	var storyElementsPosition = [];

	for(var s = 0; s < storyElements.length; s++) {
		var position = storyElements[s].querySelector('.story__score').getBoundingClientRect();
		if(position.top <= -50) {
			continue;
		}

		if(position.top >= mainHeight) {
			break;
		}
		storyElementsInScreen.push(storyElements[s]);
		storyElementsPosition.push(position);
	}
	...
}
```
###onStoryClick

- Uses a setTimeout to start showing the story.
```
function onStoryClick(details) {
	...
	// setTimeout(showStory.bind(this, details.id, mainPosition), 60); // hide orginal code here

	...
		
	showStory(details.id,mainPosition); // add showStory here
}
```
- Just splats the DOM in rather than using a rAF.
```
nothing in StoryClick , where is rAF?
```
Same for the comments.
```

```
###showStory

Adds an overbroad class on the body.
Uses setTimeout for animation and runs it every 4ms
Causes forced sync layouts if it runs multiple times per frame due to getBoundingClientRect and storyDetails left style setting.
###hideStory

Same as above.
###colorizeAndScaleStories

Completely unnecessary effect (interesting to see if any students drop it altogether - they should consider it imo, but if not there's loads they can do).
Colors every single score.
Sets the width and height (should be a scale transform) triggering a global layout.
Then reads it back to figure the color it needs (way daft).
Triggers layout thrashing in the process.
###touchstart

This just shouldn't be here and it just periodically kills touch input, so hopefully they'll realize what a bad thing touch handlers can be.
###scroll

Really, we don't want to color and scale the scores.
Should be in a requestAnimationFrame as it makes visual changes.
###loadStoryBatch

Making visual changes outside of a requestAnimationFrame.
###App.Data.get*

Could be done in a worker (although likely not a big deal)
###Bonuses

Inline scripts in the top of the head.
Fixed position header will be repainting (.header) on low DPI devices.
So will .main (low DPI only) so ideally it needs promoting.
